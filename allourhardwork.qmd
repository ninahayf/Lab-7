With Denver's elevation being significantly higher than New Orleans will give us a foundations to compare the extreme changes that happen at different elevations.

This plot shows the UHI difference (in °F) for both cities. New Orleans's higher UHI is expected because of the low-elevation and humidity and the fact that it is pretty warm there year round. This creates a greater challenge for New Orleans when it comes to managing heat. Denver's UHI isn't nearly as bad because of the dry air and higher elevation.

```
New Orleans has more missing data values than Denver did, hence why the dramatic difference. Setting aside climate change, we know that New Orleans has significantly more hot days than Denver because its closer to the equator.
